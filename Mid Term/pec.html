She has proven to be an exceptionally efficient and effective Senator.
            On this momentous occasion, I would like to extend my felicitations to all the Engineers of Pakistan and our esteemed Engineer Parliamentarians. With the establishment of this Caucus, Insha’Allah I am confident that the Parliamentarian, in collaboration with this Caucus, will play their pivotal role in shaping policies for the betterment of Pakistan and fostering the engineering profession/sector in future.
            Once again, I commend you on taking this excellent initiative. Thank you”
